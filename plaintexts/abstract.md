How do our CS teachers teach programming?
This question is still one of the overarching questions that remain unanswered in the young field, Computer Science Education. 
In this paper we explore one of the trending research topics in science education, PCK. 
PCK or pedagogical content knowledge was introduced by Lee Shulman in the 1980's.
Many studies on measuring PCK have reported that the methods they have used are too complicated, too abstract, or too expensive.
Therefore, in this paper we introduce simple, quantifiable, and cheap method for PCK measurement. 
It focuses on the manifestations on PCK, specifically knowledge on student misconceptions. 
Using a validated multiple test exam for students (SCS1), we compile common misconceptions on each topic by recording common mistakes of the students in a pre-test.
We then build a multiple choice questionnaire for teachers based on these misconceptions.
After that, measure the scores teachers get in their questionnaire and the scores students get in their post test.
The correlation of the two values will indicate if this method is a viable method for measuring PCK.
The methods introduced in this research can be used to improve CS instruction, providing empirical measurements of teaching practices.
These methods can provide improvement based teacher training.
The tools provided by these methods can also be used to identify hard to teach topics, contributing knowledge on CS instruction.
Ultmately these methods can be used to build tools that can provide knowledge on how CS teachers teach programming.
