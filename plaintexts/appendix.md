| ***Can the SCS1 test be repurposed into a PCK test?***                                   | x CS2 classes  | Students will take the SCS1 pre test to compile common misconceptions. Based on these misconceptions a PCK test for teachers will be created to test if they can identify common misconceptions. Students will then take SCS1 post test at the end of the course. | Pearsons r correlation to measure the correlation between Teacher's PCK scores and student learning gains (SCS1 posttest scores - SCS1 pretest scores). Positive correlation means that SCS1 can be repurposed as PCK measurement tool. | Yes it can be used                                     |
| ***How does CS teachers? PCK relate to students? learning?***                            | x CS2 classes  | Students will take the SCS1 pre test to compile common misconceptions. Based on these misconceptions a PCK test for teachers will be created to test if they can identify common misconceptions. Students will then take SCS1 post test at the end of the course. | Pearsons r correlation to measure the correlation between Teacher's PCK scores and student learning gains (SCS1 posttest scores - SCS1 pretest scores)                                                                                  | High positive corelation between the two               |
| *How does CS teachers? content knowledge score relate to students? learning?*            | x CS2 classes  | Students will take the SCS1 pre test to compile common misconceptions. Teachers will take SCS1 test once. Students will then take SCS1 post test at the end of the course.                                                                                        | Pearsons r correlation to measure the correlation between Teacher's SCS1 scores and student learning gains (SCS1 posttest scores - SCS1 pretest scores)                                                                                 | Low to zero correlation between the wo                 |

Based on these misconceptions a PCK test for teachers will be created to test if they can identify common misconceptions. Students will then take SCS1 post test at the end of the course. | Pearsons r correlation to measure the correlation between Teacher's PCK scores and student learning gains (SCS1 posttest scores - SCS1 pretest scores)                                                                                  |                                                        |
