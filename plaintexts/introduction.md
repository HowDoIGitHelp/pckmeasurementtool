# Introduction
## The field of genomics
It was 22 years ago, back in 1995 when the first free living genome was sequenced [@Fleischmann1995].  
It was the genome of the bacterium *H. influenzae*, containing 1,830,137 base pairs.
Only eight years after the publishing of *H. influenzae* genome, in 2002, the Human Genome Project was completed [@Tripp2011].
Started back in 1990, the project was a true scientific marvel, a product of contributions from multiple universities and laboratories around the world.
The project involved a tedious process of experimentally obtaining segments of DNA and a more tedious process of reassembling the segments.
After the 12 year long ordeal, the whole project completely sequenced the 3.3 billion base pair long human genome.
The Human Genome Project inspired the emergence of research about genomes and sequencing tools and processes.
The project also inspired the emergence of many genomics related researches in the field of bioinformatics, like sequence analysis, genome annotation and sequence databases.

## There is an abundance of genomic data
Now in 2017, the field genomics is on the background of the big data and machine learning age.  
The emergence of big data and the advancements in bio-informatics brought upon the abundance of high quality genetic data [@Thanassi2002; @Mushegian1996; @VanTonder2014].
This is facilitated by public databases like GenBank, the Sequence Read Archive and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) [@Leinonen2011; @Benson2000a; @Leinonen2011a].
These databases store sequences derived from innovations from next generation sequencing.
Next generation sequencing is a group of modern genome sequencing technologies that are reportedly powerful enough to sequence the whole human genome in a single day [@Behjati2013].
Computationally powerful machines combined with computationally power techniques like this, give the field of genomics better tools as it revisits some of biology's difficult questions.

## The importance of solving the following research questions
### The fewest parts  to construct a cell.
There have been many attempts to answer this question through theory and small scale experimentation [@Glass2006].
Finding the minimal gene set (i.e smallest set of genes that can support life) can provide basis for synthetic biology [@Lluch-Senar2015].
Synthetic biology is an emerging interdisciplinary field of biology and engineering.
This field studies on the synthesis and application of artificial biological systems.
Although there are many attempts in creating artificial life that are relatively successful, none of these attempts have gone as close as creating free living cells [@Ferber2004].
By finding the minimal set of genes that can support life the current understanding of simple biological systems will improve making the road to the first free living artificial life one step closer.

### Effective ways to kill cells
By determining the minimal set of bacterial genes, it will be easier to differentiate essential and non-essential genes.
This will give antibiotics better techniques in killing pathogenic bacteria by disabling essential genes [@Akerley1998].
Gene targeting with the knowledge of gene essentiality can be a very effective means of killing pathogenic bacteria [@Zhang2009].
Knowledge of gene essentiality will provide pharmaceutical research advanced antibiotic techiniques like general bacteria killers and species specific bacteria killers.
