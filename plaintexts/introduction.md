#Introduction
## We don't know how CS teachers teach
Despite the demand for high quality educators in Computer Science almost nothing is known about how our teacher's teach programming.
The teaching strategies and practices that CS teachers use are not empirically reviewed.
Because of this, the knowledge that Computer Science teachers use in order to teach CS concepts remains unclear.
For example, Pears et. al's (2007) literature review on introductory programming instruction failed to provide an answer on how to teach introductory CS due to the scarcity of systematic evidence that may support any answer [@Pears2007].
This is not surprising due to the fact that Computer Science Education is young compared to other scientific fields like Physics, Biology and Chemistry.
Because Computer Science Education is a relatively young field, there is no benchmark on how good CS teachers teach Computer Science or how effective current practices are.
 
## Measuring PCK is difficult
One of the trending fields in in science education research right now is about teacher knowledge. 
One of the domains of teacher knowledge is the construct of teacher's pedagogical content knowledge (PCK).
PCK is a construct introduced by the Social Science researcher Lee Shulman in the 1890's (need exact).
Although this construct has been around for decades, the most recent breakthroughs on this field are about PCK's theoretical roots and PCK's conceptualizations. [@Park2008]
Many researchers have discussed the complexity of PCK [@Rohaan2009,@Yadav2016 ] and because of this, there is yet to be a widely used measurement tool for it.
Measuring a teacher's PCK directly is difficult, it is challenging to document such a broad and abstract concept.
This is bigger problem on young research fields like Computer Science Education. 
Because of all of this, Computer Science Education research falls behind other fields in terms of an understanding of teacher's PCK [@Yadav2016 ].
 
## PCK is an empirical evidence for good teaching practices
Currently there are no widely accepted standards of teaching in Computer Science Education  [@Rohaan2009].
This affects Computer Science teachers' personal standards of teaching. 
When CS teachers' decide to switch between preferred teaching techniques and practices they base their choice on anecdotal evidences, informal judgement, and intuition [@Fossati2011 ].
Measuring PCK for introductory CS teachers will allow us to compare teaching practices using empirical evidence. 
This is important because, empirical evidence is needed so that the community can use research to answer questions on how to teach programming [@Pears2007].
 
## PCK measures identify difficult to teach topics
Measuring mean PCK of teachers for each topic will give us insights on which topics are harder to teach. 
Topics in which teachers generally have lower levels of PCK can help identify topics in which teachers have trouble teaching.
By combining knowledge of hard to teach topics to our existing knowledge of topics CS students have trouble learning [@Goldman2008] we can verify if these two sets of topics are similar to each other.
Knowing this will provide evidence to the hypothesis that poor performances of CS students are caused by poor teaching practices of CS teachers.
 
## Good measures develop good teachers
There is demand for high quality CS teachers in the world right now. 
This makes the need for effective teacher training imminent.
To create frameworks of improvement - focused teacher evaluation system, measurements for effective teaching is needed [@METProject2013].
Multiple measures are needed in order to measure the multiple facets of science education.
And from this measures we can build a good teacher evaluation system that can be the basis on how we train our teachers.
Data from these measurements will show which teaching practices should be improved, changed or invested on [@METProject2013 ].
Therefore PCK measurement tools will contribute knowledge on good standards of CS teaching which will be useful for CS teacher training.
