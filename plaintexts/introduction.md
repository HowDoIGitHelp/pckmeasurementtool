# Introduction
The first free living genome was sequenced in 1995 [@Fleischmann1995].
It was the genome of the bacterium *H. influenzae*, containing 1,830,137 base pairs.
Eight years after the publishing of *H. influenzae* genome, in 2002, the Human Genome Project was completed [@Tripp2011].
Started in 1990, the project was a product of contributions from multiple universities and laboratories around the world.
The project involved a laborious process of experimentally obtaining segments of DNA and a more laborious process of reassembling the segments.
After 12 years, the whole project completely sequenced the 3.3 billion base pair long human genome.
The Human Genome Project inspired the emergence of research about genomes and sequencing tools and processes.
The project also inspired the emergence of many genomics related researches in the field of bioinformatics, like sequence analysis, genome annotation and sequence databases.

## There is an abundance of genomic data
Currently, the field genomics is on the background of the big data and machine learning age.
The emergence of big data and the advancements in bio-informatics brought upon the abundance of high quality genetic data [@Thanassi2002; @Mushegian1996; @VanTonder2014].
This is facilitated by public databases like GenBank, the Sequence Read Archive and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) [@Leinonen2011; @Benson2000a; @Leinonen2011a].
These databases store sequences derived from innovations from next generation sequencing. Next generation sequencing is a group of modern genome sequencing technologies that are reportedly powerful enough to sequence the whole human genome in a single day.
Computationally powerful machines combined with computationally powerful techniques like next generation sequencing, give the field of genomics better tools as it revisits some of biology's difficult questions.

## The fewest parts  to construct a cell.
One of difficult open questions in biology right now is the study on the search for the minimal set of genes.
Finding the minimal gene set is the attempt to identify the smallest set of genes that can support life [@Koonin2000].
There have been many attempts to answer this question through theory and small scale experimentation [@Glass2006].
Identifying minimal gene set can provide basis for synthetic biology [@Lluch-Senar2015], which is an emerging interdisciplinary field of biology and engineering.
This field studies the synthesis and application of artificial biological systems.
Although there are many attempts in creating artificial life that are relatively successful, none of these attempts have gone as close as creating free living cells [@Ferber2004].
By finding the minimal set of genes that can support life the current understanding of simple biological systems will improve making the road to the first free living artificial life one step closer.

## Effective ways to kill cells
Another application of determining the minimal set of genes is in differentiating essential and non-essential genes in bacterial genomes.
This will give antibiotics better techniques in killing pathogenic bacteria by disabling essential genes [@Akerley1998]. Gene targeting with the knowledge of gene essentiality can be a very effective means of killing pathogenic bacteria [@Zhang2009].
Knowledge of gene essentiality will provide pharmaceutical research advanced antibiotic techniques like general bacteria killers and species specific bacteria killers.

## The goals of this study
This study aims to model the minimum set of genes using machine learning algorithms.
This study also aims to document the applicability of machine learning methods as modelling tools for the minimum set of genes.
The ultimate goal of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the minimum set of genes by proposing its methodology.

In the following chapter this study will discuss, the biological concepts relating to the minimal set of genes.
The following chapter will also contain previous work that contribute to the study on the minimal set of genes along with the accomplished milestones and gaps in knowledge.
The next chapter will discuss on which methods this study has chosen to contribute to the current gaps in knowledge.
After that there will be a chapter comparing the results between the findings from this and the findings from previous studies.
Finally, the last chapter will include a summary of the whole paper, some recommendations and the impact of this study.
