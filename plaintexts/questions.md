# Research questions
Based on these gaps in knowledge this research question is formulated:

#### Are these machine learning classifiers a valid tool for determining the minimal set of genes?
Although, there have been few studies that use machine learning tools in the study of the minimum set of genes, there have been no studies that document the applicability of various machine learning methods [@VanTonder2014]. Basing on these few promising machine learning studies this study hypothesizes that machine learning classifiers will be a useful tool to be used in determining the minimal set of genes.
