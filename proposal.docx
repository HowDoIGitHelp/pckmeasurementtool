\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{We don't know how CS teachers
teach}\label{we-dont-know-how-cs-teachers-teach}

Despite the demand for high quality educators in Computer Science almost
nothing is known about how our teacher's teach programming. The teaching
strategies and practices that CS teachers use are not empirically
reviewed. Because of this, the knowledge that Computer Science teachers
use in order to teach CS concepts remains unclear. For example, Pears
et. al's (2007) literature review on introductory programming
instruction failed to provide an answer on how to teach introductory CS
due to the scarcity of systematic evidence that may support any answer
(Pears et al., 2007). This is not surprising due to the fact that
Computer Science Education is young compared to other scientific fields
like Physics, Biology and Chemistry. Because Computer Science Education
is a relatively young field, there is no benchmark on how good CS
teachers teach Computer Science or how effective current practices are.

\section{Measuring PCK is difficult}\label{measuring-pck-is-difficult}

One of the trending fields in in science education research right now is
about teacher knowledge. One of the domains of teacher knowledge is the
construct of teacher's pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). PCK is a
construct introduced by the Social Science researcher Lee Shulman in the
1890's (need exact). Although this construct has been around for
decades, the most recent breakthroughs on this field are about PCK's
theoretical roots and PCK's conceptualizations. (Park \& Oliver, 2008)
Many researchers have discussed the complexity of PCK (Rohaan, Taconis,
\& Jochems, 2009,Yadav, Berges, Sands, \& Good (2016)) and because of
this, there is yet to be a widely used measurement tool for it.
Measuring a teacher's PCK directly is difficult, it is challenging to
document such a broad and abstract concept. This is bigger problem on
young research fields like Computer Science Education. Because of all of
this, Computer Science Education research falls behind other fields in
terms of an understanding of teacher's PCK (Yadav et al., 2016 ).

\section{PCK is an empirical evidence for good teaching
practices}\label{pck-is-an-empirical-evidence-for-good-teaching-practices}

Currently there are no widely accepted standards of teaching in Computer
Science Education (Rohaan et al., 2009). This affects Computer Science
teachers' personal standards of teaching. When CS teachers' decide to
switch between preferred teaching techniques and practices they base
their choice on anecdotal evidences, informal judgement, and intuition
(Fossati \& Guzdial, 2011 ). Measuring PCK for introductory CS teachers
will allow us to compare teaching practices using empirical evidence.
This is important because, empirical evidence is needed so that the
community can use research to answer questions on how to teach
programming (Pears et al., 2007).

\section{PCK measures identify difficult to teach
topics}\label{pck-measures-identify-difficult-to-teach-topics}

Measuring mean PCK of teachers for each topic will give us insights on
which topics are harder to teach. Topics in which teachers generally
have lower levels of PCK can help identify topics in which teachers have
trouble teaching. By combining knowledge of hard to teach topics to our
existing knowledge of topics CS students have trouble learning (Goldman
et al., 2008) we can verify if these two sets of topics are similar to
each other. Knowing this will provide evidence to the hypothesis that
poor performances of CS students are caused by poor teaching practices
of CS teachers.

\section{Good measures develop good
teachers}\label{good-measures-develop-good-teachers}

There is demand for high quality CS teachers in the world right now.
This makes the need for effective teacher training imminent. To create
frameworks of improvement - focused teacher evaluation system,
measurements for effective teaching is needed (MET Project, 2013).
Multiple measures are needed in order to measure the multiple facets of
science education. And from this measures we can build a good teacher
evaluation system that can be the basis on how we train our teachers.
Data from these measurements will show which teaching practices should
be improved, changed or invested on (MET Project, 2013 ). Therefore PCK
measurement tools will contribute knowledge on good standards of CS
teaching which will be useful for CS teacher training.

\chapter{Related Work}\label{related-work}

\section{Theoretical Perspectives}\label{theoretical-perspectives}

\subsection{PCK as a knowledge base is a blend of pedagogy and
content}\label{pck-as-a-knowledge-base-is-a-blend-of-pedagogy-and-content}

Shulman (1987) described PCK as ``the blending of content and pedagogy
into an understanding of how particular topics, problems, or issues are
organised, represented, and adapted to the diverse interests and
abilities of learners, and presented for instruction'' (1986 ). It is
one of the 7 knowledge bases a teacher draws from when reaching. PCK is
separate from but related to a teacher's pedagogy as well as a teacher's
content knowledge. For example an introductory computer science teacher
with pedagogy and content knowledge only draws from his/her general
pedagogical techniques to teach recursive statements. This teacher knows
the concept of recursion and this teacher also knows how to speak in
public and knows how to make tests. On the other hand a teacher with a
developed pedagogical content knowledge knows how to specifically teach
recursion. This teacher knows the common questions students have about
recursion, knows which questions to ask to effectively test students'
knowledge in recursion and knows students' misconceptions about
recursion.

\subsection{Students develop a teachers
PCK}\label{students-develop-a-teachers-pck}

Shulman (1987) has suggested that the development of a teacher's PCK is
affected by the students that the teachers teach (1987). According to
Shulman (1987), students affect teachers' PCK through formal and
informal assessments but a more recent study has shown that there are
more direct means that students impact a teacher's PCK (Park \& Oliver,
2008 ; 1987).

One way students affect the development of PCK is through challenging
questions that facilitate subject matter knowledge (Park \& Oliver,
2008). Although subject matter knowledge is a separate knowledge base
from PCK it has been considered one of the criterions for PCK
development (Driel, Verloop, \& Vos, 1998). The teachers studied by Park
and Oliver (2008) often encountered students questions which challenge
their subject matter knowledge. These encounters changed the teachers
subject matter knowledge so that it could be used to teach students
successfully (2008).

A second means of student impact on the development of PCK is through
the assessment of student participation and responses during class.
Student participation and response is manifested from ``students'
enjoyment, evidence of learning, and other nonverbal reactions to
instructional strategies''. Based on these informal responses teachers
instructional strategies are replaced, modified or validated (Fossati \&
Guzdial, 2011; Park \& Oliver, 2008).

The third means of PCK development from teacher responses is from
assessing students' creative and critical ideas. This simply means that
that students critical inputs and ideas during class are used by the
teacher to look for innovative and interesting strategies of teaching
(Park \& Oliver, 2008).

\subsection{Knowledge of students' misconceptions is a sign of a
developed
PCK}\label{knowledge-of-students-misconceptions-is-a-sign-of-a-developed-pck}

Student misconceptions about the topic also shape the teacher's PCK.
Knowledge on student misconceptions is transformed into the knowledge of
techniques on how to teach the topic that addresses the misconception or
avoids the formation of the misconception (Park \& Oliver, 2008). Park
and Oliver's (2008) findings show that teachers understanding of their
students' misconceptions shaped the entire teaching process ``from
planning to assessment'' (2008). Their interviews with teachers show
that expanding teacher's knowledge of student misconception ultimately
improved their PCK. From this, Park and Oliver (2008) concluded that
``as teachers developed better understanding of students'
misconceptions, their PCK became more sophisticated'' (2008).

This supports Shulman's (1986) early incarnations of the PCK construct
(1986). Shulman (1986) included knowledge of student misconceptions as
one of the components of PCK. According to him, student preconceptions,
which are often misconceptions, require teaching strategies that
reorganize these into correct conceptions (Shulman, 1986). Even non-PCK
related teaching studies have suggested that teachers' knowledge of
student misconceptions is crucial for effective teaching (Ausubel,
1968). Some researchers even stress that KOSM is a required knowledge
base for teachers who teach the topics (Carlsen, 1999).

\subsection{Misconceptions relate PCK to Conceptual Change
Theory}\label{misconceptions-relate-pck-to-conceptual-change-theory}

One of the emerging conceptual change theory perspectives is the idea of
theory change. It states that learners' conceptual frameworks are
embedded intuitively and that it is different from that of an expert's
conceptual framework. Therefore, these learners' conceptual frameworks
require substantial restructuring to resemble the conceptual framework
of an expert (Carey, 1985).

Learner's conceptual frameworks are comparable to the preconceptions of
a student before a course. These preconceptions are often misconceptions
that require restructuring in the form of science education (Shulman,
1986). Therefore, teachers equipped with the knowledge of these
misconceptions become more effective catalysts of theory change. These
teachers become better at shaping learners' conceptual frameworks
(misconceptions) into experts' conceptual frameworks (correct
conceptions). It could be argued that the motivation for teaching
learners is not the process of filling up a learners blank slate but the
process of changing the wrong contents of the learners' slate into
correct contents (Sadler, Gerhard, Coyle, \& Nancy, 2013). Recent papers
on Conceptual Change theory suggest that this theory provides a bridging
gap in researches of student errors and instructional practice. Duit and
Treagust (2003) discuss the possible use of conceptual change process to
examine scientific literacy to provide a framework for science education
and teaching (2003).

\section{State of the Art}\label{state-of-the-art}

\subsection{Measuring PCK
qualitatively}\label{measuring-pck-qualitatively}

Loughran et. al's (2001) early works in representing PCK was through
Pedagogical and Professional - experience Repertoirs (PaP-eRs)
(Loughran, Berry, \& Mulhall, 2012; Loughran, Milroy, Berry, Gunstone,
\& Mulhall, 2001). This method involves documenting on paper teacher's
practices, anecdotes and insights on a topic. Although teachers PaP-eRs
of a topic is not a complete representation of PCK it is a useful tool
for sharing PCK in practice. Loughran et. al (200?) later expanded the
documentation of PCK by adding the tool Context Representations (CoRe)
which details their overview of concepts related to the topic (Loughran
et al., 2012).

Based on Loughran et. al's (2012) CoRe's deBeer's (2009) study compiled
a list of \emph{Big Ideas} specifically for introductory computer
science education (2009; 2012). The Big Ideas were produced using
semi-structured group discussions of computer science teachers. Each of
these Big Ideas have corresponding questions that assess a teachers'
content knowledge, teaching strategies, and other pedagogical insights
in said topic.

One of the most recent studies also use open ended questions for
measuring PCK (Yadav et al., 2016). Yadav et al. (2016) used open-ended
questionnaires that present common Computer Science situations that
teachers may encounter. Although this test doesn't yield quantitative
data, the teacher's responses generate rich qualitative data sets.

\subsection{Measuring PCK
quantitatively}\label{measuring-pck-quantitatively}

Some studies used multiple choice approaches for easily quantifiable
measurements of PCK. Although not exactly for PCK, one of the earliest
test questionnaires to measure PCK was from Kromney and Renfrow's C-P
items (1991 ). This study built multiple choice questions to measure
content-specific pedagogical knowledge (Kromrey \& Renfrow, 1991).
Rohaan et. al. (2009) a constructed multiple choice questionnaire called
the \emph{Teaching of Technology Test} for primary technology education
teachers (2009). Instead of using empirical data, the study used expert
judgments to examine the contents validity.

\subsection{KOSM and student learning}\label{kosm-and-student-learning}

New studies on quantitative PCK measurements have focused on teacher's
understanding of student misconceptions. Juttner and Neuhaus (2010)
created PCK questions based on empirically analysed student errors to be
used for a PCK test for biology teachers (JÃ¼ttner \& Neuhaus, 2010).\\
The process for creating these test questions start with the gathering
of the most common student misconceptions using a multiple-choice test
for students. Questions for teachers are then created based on the
common misconceptions gathered.

A similar process is also used by researchers from other fields. A study
on the influence of teacher knowledge on middle school classrooms show
that the teachers who could identify popular misconceptions had much
larger classroom gains compared to teachers who only knew the answer
(Sadler et al., 2013). In addition to that, this research concluded that
a multiple choice assessment instrument could be used to assess the SMK
(subject matter knowledge) and KOSM (knowledge on student misconception)
of teachers. While Sadler's study doesn't explicitly discuss the concept
of PCK itself, several conceptual studies discussed above show that the
KOSM of students that Sadler identified are manifestations of PCK (Park
\& Oliver, 2008 ; Shulman, 1986). This study, like Juttner and Neuhaus'
(2010) study constructed test questions and answers which are grounded
by empirical evidence. Although, Juttner and Neuhaus' (2009) study
unlike Sadler et. al's (2013) study, focuses on the source of student
misconceptions more than the validity of the constructed PCK test
(JÃ¼ttner \& Neuhaus, 2010; Sadler et al., 2013).

On the field of Computer Science Education, some studies are also
starting to consider misconceptions in PCK. Ohrndorf and Schubert (2013)
created some test items to be used to assess student teacher's PCK. The
test items created in this study are based on three measurable aspects
of PCK: PCK test, PCK student, and PCK instruction. PCK student test
items are questions on student's misconceptions and PCK instructions are
questions on how to create instructions for solving misconceptions
(Ohrndorf \& Schubert, 2013). One of main differences of Ohrndorf and
Schubert's (2013) study to Sadler et. al's study and Juttner and
Neuhaus' (2010) study is that the formermost study created a test which
yields qualitative data.

\section{Gaps in Knowledge}\label{gaps-in-knowledge}

\subsection{Our current PCK tools are hard to
build}\label{our-current-pck-tools-are-hard-to-build}

Most PCK representation and measurement techniques involve verbalizing
teaching practices or observing classroom management by teachers which
easily highlight PCK in action (Beer, 2009; Loughran et al., 2012, 2001;
Ohrndorf \& Schubert, 2013; Rohaan et al., 2009; Yadav et al., 2016).
But the problem is that these methods yield data which are too abstract
or too difficult to quantitatively measure. Teachers may have
difficulties in converting their own techniques into words introducing
more variables and more complications in gathering the data. Also,
current measurement tools (both qualitative and quantitative) are
complicated to create from scratch. These tools and tests are derived
from meetings and discussions by teachers or experts in the field (Beer,
2009; Loughran et al., 2012, 2001; Rohaan et al., 2009; Yadav et al.,
2016) which require more planning than other knowledge bases like
content knowledge (Kromrey \& Renfrow, 1991). This is especially
difficult since teacher's PCK is unique for each content. It will be
very expensive and time consuming if we were to attempt building PCK
tests for multiple topics using these methods.

\subsection{PCK specific to CS
education}\label{pck-specific-to-cs-education}

Currently there are studies that show that effective middle school
teachers are aware of the common misconceptions on the field they are
teaching (Sadler et al., 2013 ) but there are no studies in CS right now
that demonstrate this correlation. It has been shown that a
multiple-choice questionnaire for students can be used as a KOSM
(knowledge on student misconceptions) test for teachers. This was
performed on middle school classes. Whether or not this is true on CS1
classes is not known as of the moment.

\subsection{The set of topics which are difficult to
teach}\label{the-set-of-topics-which-are-difficult-to-teach}

While there are studies that show which concepts CS students are having
a difficulty on learning, there are no studies that identify which
concepts CS teachers have difficulty in teaching (Goldman et al., 2008).
Measuring the mean PCK of teachers around the world for each topic will
reveal the topics that teachers have low PCK on. (help bad sentence)
These topics will reveal insights on hard to teach concepts. This set of
topics is important to find since the intersection between the set of
hard to teach topics and the set of hard to learn topics will be provide
evidence that CS students cant learn because CS teachers cant teach.

\chapter{Research questions}\label{research-questions}

Because of these gaps in knowledge we aim to answer these questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Can the SCS1 test be repurposed into a PCK test?}}
\end{itemize}

It has been shown in a previous study that a validated multiple choice
tests for middle school students can be used to calculate teacher's
knowledge on student misconceptions (Sadler et al., 2013 ). The SCS1 is
proven to be a usable PCK tool if we find positive correlation between
student gains and PCK tool test.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{How does CS teachers' PCK relate to students'
  learning?}}
\end{itemize}

Using the tool derived from SCS1 we will be able to measure the
relationship between CS teachers PCK and student learning gains. The
same tool can also be used to measure the following PCK related
knowledge bases.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{How does CS teachers' content knowledge score relate to
  students' learning?}
\item
  \emph{How does CS teachers' ability to identify misconceptions relate
  to students' learning?}
\end{itemize}

These specific research questions are asked so that we can measure how
these knowledge bases relate to each other and also which of them matter
the most.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Which introductory programming concepts are hard to
  teach?}}
\end{itemize}

The tool can be used to measure the average PCK of teachers for each
item in the repurposed SCS1 test. Test items in which teachers generally
score low PCK can provide insight on which introductory computer science
topics are hard to teach.

\chapter{Methodology}\label{methodology}

\section{Research Method}\label{research-method}

It is much harder to measure each aspect of teacher competency to
control the independent variable. Therefore the study cannot measure
causal relationships. Also it is unethical to deliberately subject the
students to incompetent teachers. According to Cohen et. al. (2007) the
type of research most suitable is \emph{ex post facto research} under a
co-relational design (2007). \emph{Ex post facto} research method is
used if the researchers are unable to conduct a controlled experiment.
Instead of meticulously controlling and manipulating every variable
before conducting the experiment, \emph{ex post facto} research only
requires data collection and data analysis to test the hypothesis. A
co-relational design of \emph{ex post facto} research is the research
design used when the researchers cannot collect data for all variables.
This design cannot test causal relationships but can prove correlation
relationships.

\section{Data Collection}\label{data-collection}

To measure student learning a validated introductory CS test will be
used. The students will take pre-tests and post-tests to measure the
improvement in scores. At the early part of the semester x CS2 classes
will take the SCS1 exam as a pre test. To generate the pck test, each
test question in the SCS1 exam will be converted to a pck test question
that would let the teacher identify from the SCS1 choices which are the
most common misconceptions. An SCS1 post test will be administered
towards the end of the semester and the improvement of scores from the
post test will be measured.

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}

There are two available student test data after the pre test. One is
from the pre-tests administered on the students teached by the teachers
taking the PCK tests and another data available is from SCS1 pre tests
taken by CS1 students from around the world. Because of the possibility
that these two groups of data will show different frequencies of common
misconceptions, teachers' answers will be marked based on the two groups
of student test data. Pearsons r correlation will be used to measure the
relationship of pck and the learning of students throughout the
semester. Teachers' PCK scores will be correlated against the
improvement of SCS1 scores of the students they are teaching.
Correlation will be measured per test item and overall score as well. We
can accept the hypothesis that the SCS1 can be used as an instrument for
PCK testing if the students under higher PCK scoring teachers show
larger differences in SCS1 post and pre test scores. Using the PCK test
scores of the teachers, test items in which average scores are low will
be chosen. The topics in which theses items belong to are identified as
hard topics to teach.

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Computer science education is a relatively new field of research. There
are so many studies in which we highlight how students learn CS and
there are so many hypotheses on why they have difficulties on it. And
while there are studies that investigate how we teach CS, our knowledge
on CS teaching is thinner compared to our knowledge in CS learning.
Because of that, this study focuses on the measurement of PCK; it is an
emerging construct introduced by Lee Shulman in the 1890's.

PCK, the blend of pedagogy and content knowledge, is a knowledge base
used by teachers to teach specific topics. It is a construct that is
useful in investigating the unique ways in which we teach complex
subjects like programming. While the concept of PCK is promising for
CSED , data on CS teachers is hard to find. Teachers' PCK is a highly
complex concept which can take different forms making it hard to
measure. There have been many attempts to measure PCK there are several
which focus CS teachers PCK. But these measurement methods prove to too
complicated, too abstract, or too expensive. Because of this, we offer a
simple, quantifiable, and cheap method for PCK measurement. Instead of
measuring PCK directly, we focus on the manifestations of PCK,
specifically knowledge on student misconception or KOSM. We use an
established and validated multiple choice exam for CS students, the SCS1
exam, and repurpose it to measure teachers' PCK.

The methods introduced in this research can help CS instruction in many
ways. The measurement tool itself can be a useful evaluation tool that
can encourage improvement focused teacher training. The tool can be used
to empirically measure teaching, giving us additional insights and which
teaching practices and techniques are good and which are bad. The
measurements provided by the tool can help CS curriculum by identifying
hard to teach topics. Using the tools and methods introduced in this
research we can learn a lot more on how CS teachers teach.
