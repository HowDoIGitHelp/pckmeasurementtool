#Conclusion
Computer science education is a relatively new field of research. 
There are so many studies in which we highlight how students learn CS and there are so many hypotheses on why they have difficulties on it.
And while there are studies that investigate how we teach CS, our knowledge on CS teaching is thinner compared to our knowledge in CS learning. 
Because of that, this study focuses on the measurement of PCK; it is an emerging construct introduced by Lee Shulman in the 1890's.
 
PCK, the blend of pedagogy and content knowledge, is a knowledge base used by teachers to teach specific topics.
It is a construct that is useful in investigating the unique ways in which we teach complex subjects like programming.
While the concept of PCK is promising for CSED , data on CS teachers is hard to find.
Teachers' PCK is a highly complex concept which can take different forms making it hard to measure.
There have been many attempts to measure PCK there are several which focus CS teachers PCK.
But these measurement methods prove to too complicated, too abstract, or too expensive.
Because of this, we offer a simple, quantifiable, and cheap method for PCK measurement.
Instead of measuring PCK directly, we focus on the manifestations of PCK, specifically knowledge on student misconception or KOSM.
We use an established and validated multiple choice exam for CS students, the SCS1 exam, and repurpose it to measure teachers' PCK.
 
The methods introduced in this research can help CS instruction in many ways. 
The measurement tool itself can be a useful evaluation tool that can encourage improvement focused teacher training.
The tool can be used to empirically measure teaching, giving us additional insights and which teaching practices and techniques are good and which are bad.
The measurements provided by the tool can help CS curriculum by identifying hard to teach topics.
Using the tools and methods introduced in this research we can learn a lot more on how CS teachers teach.
