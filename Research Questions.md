#Research questions
Because of these gaps in knowledge we aim to answer these questions:
 
- ***Can the SCS1 test be repurposed into a PCK test?***
 
It has been shown in a previous study that a validated multiple choice tests for middle school students can be used to calculate teacher's knowledge on student misconceptions [@Sadler2013 ].
The SCS1 is proven to be a usable PCK tool if we find positive correlation between student gains and PCK tool test.
 
- ***How does CS teachers’ PCK relate to students’ learning?***
 
Using the tool derived from SCS1 we will be able to measure the relationship between CS teachers PCK and student learning gains.
The same tool can also be used to measure the following PCK related knowledge bases.
 
- *How does CS teachers’ content knowledge score relate to students’ learning?*
 
- *How does CS teachers’ ability to identify misconceptions relate to students’ learning?*
 
These specific research questions are asked so that we can measure how these knowledge bases relate to each other and also which of them matter the most.
 
- ***Which introductory programming concepts are hard to teach?***
 
The tool can be used to measure the average PCK of teachers for each item in the repurposed SCS1 test.
Test items in which teachers generally score low PCK can provide insight on which introductory computer science topics are hard to teach.
