# Methodology
##Research Method
It is much harder to measure each aspect of teacher competency to control the independent variable. 
Therefore the study cannot measure causal relationships. 
Also it is unethical to deliberately subject the students to incompetent teachers.
According to Cohen et. al. (2007) the type of research most suitable is *ex post facto research* under a co-relational design [-@Cohen2007].
*Ex post facto* research method is used if the researchers are unable to conduct a controlled experiment.
Instead of meticulously controlling and manipulating every variable before conducting the experiment, *ex post facto* research only requires data collection and data analysis to test the hypothesis.
A co-relational design of *ex post facto* research is the research design used when the researchers cannot collect data for all variables.
This design cannot test causal relationships but can prove correlation relationships.
 
##Data Collection
To measure student learning a validated introductory CS test will be used.
The students will take pre-tests and post-tests to measure the improvement in scores.
At the early part of the semester x CS2 classes will take the SCS1 exam as a pre test.
To generate the pck test, each test question in the SCS1 exam will be converted to a pck test question that would let the teacher identify from the SCS1 choices which are the most common misconceptions. 
An SCS1 post test will be administered towards the end of the semester and the improvement of scores from the post test will be measured.
 
##Analysis
There are two available student test data after the pre test. One is from the pre-tests administered on the students teached by the teachers taking the PCK tests and another data available is from SCS1 pre tests taken by CS1 students from around the world. 
Because of the possibility that these two groups of data will show different frequencies of common misconceptions, teachers' answers will be marked based on the two groups of student test data. 
Pearsons r correlation will be used to measure the relationship of pck and the learning of students throughout the semester. 
Teachers' PCK scores will be correlated against the improvement of SCS1 scores of the students they are teaching. Correlation will be measured per test item and overall score as well. 
We can accept the hypothesis that the SCS1 can be used as an instrument for PCK testing if the students under higher PCK scoring teachers show larger differences in SCS1 post and pre test scores.
Using the PCK test scores of the teachers, test items in which average scores are low will be chosen.
The topics in which theses items belong to are identified as hard topics to teach.
